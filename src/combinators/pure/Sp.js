 *
 * The **S'** combinator applies both its second and third arguments separately to its
 * fourth argument, then it applies its first argument to the two results. This has the
 * effect of passing an argument to two different unary functions and then combining the
 * results with a binary function.
 *
 * This is similar to the **{@link module:combinators/pure.P|P}** combinator, except that
 * instead of using two different values applied to one unary function, it uses one value
 * applied to two different unary functions.
 *
 * This is a commonly seen combinator in functional and array languages. It is `liftA2` in
 * Haskell and is represented by the fork construction that originated in J and worked its
 * way into some modern dialects of APL. As such it's very useful in point-free programming.
 *
 * @param {function} a A function of two parameters. It's applied to the return values of
 *      the applications of functions `b` and `c`. Its return value becomes the return value
 *      of the combinator.
 * @param {function} b A function of one parameter. It's applied to the value `d` to produce
 *      one of the arguments for function `a`.
 * @param {function} c A function of one parameter. It's applied to the value `d` to produce
 *      one of the arguments for function `a`.
 * @param {*} d A value to which functions `b` and `c` are applied.
 * @returns {*} The result of function `a` being applied to the results of function `b`'s
 *      and function `c`'s applications to value `d`.
 * @alias module:combinators/pure.Sp
